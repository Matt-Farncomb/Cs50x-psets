# Cs50x-psets
### My psets from Harvard's EdX course Cs50x.

I have only posted pset6, pset7 and pset8 to a public repo.

**Pset 6** is an app that can be used to analyse the sentiments of tweets and the overall sentiment of twitter accounts,
that is whether or not these tweets are neagtive, positive or neutral.

**Pset 7** is an tapp hat is set up for mock stock-trading. Users can buy and sell stocks with fake money.

**Pset 8** is an app that intereacts with Google Maps API and enables users to look at articles from different cities around the US.

This readme will be improved in the future to provide more information.
